 Starting with Voluminous Energy v1.18.2-0.3.1.0, mod compatibility JSONs are no longer included in the main jar file. This mod readds those JSONs that were removed, for the purpose of not having to worry about compatibility issues due to recipe or tag changes with other mods in the main jar file. (only this mod needs to be updated, and can be removed if there's an active incompatibility, preventing things like connecting to dedicated servers).

 Additionally, this would allow modpack developers to have a clean slate by not having to include this mod with Voluminous Energy. As, in that case, the modpack developer can write their own integrations, through whichever tool or method they choose.
